# ⚙️ Steps Performed

### ✅ Step 1

Downloaded and extracted **Apache Kafka 3.9.2**.

### ✅ Step 2

Started **ZooKeeper Server** successfully.

### ✅ Step 3

Started the **Kafka Broker** successfully.

### ✅ Step 4

Created a Kafka Topic named:

```text
ChatTopic
```

using:

```cmd
bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --topic ChatTopic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```

### ✅ Step 5

Verified successful topic creation.

### ✅ Step 6

Created an **ASP.NET Core Web API** project.

### ✅ Step 7

Installed the **Confluent.Kafka** NuGet package.

### ✅ Step 8

Implemented a **Kafka Producer Service** using `ProducerBuilder`.

### ✅ Step 9

Created a REST API endpoint:

```text
POST /api/Kafka
```

to publish messages to Kafka.

### ✅ Step 10

Executed the API through **Swagger UI**.

Sample Request:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello Kafka"
}
```

### ✅ Step 11

Received a successful response from the API.

### ✅ Step 12

Started the Kafka Consumer using:

```cmd
bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --topic ChatTopic --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

### ✅ Step 13

Verified that all published messages were successfully consumed.

Cognizant Deep Skilling Exercise 6
Hello Kafka
```

---

# 🎉 Result

Successfully integrated **Apache Kafka** with an **ASP.NET Core Web API** application. Messages were published through a REST API endpoint and successfully consumed using the Kafka Console Consumer, demonstrating reliable asynchronous communication.

---

# ✅ Conclusion

This exercise successfully demonstrated the integration of **Apache Kafka** with **ASP.NET Core Web API** using the **Confluent.Kafka** library.

The application was able to:

* ✅ Publish messages to Kafka topics
* ✅ Consume messages from Kafka topics
* ✅ Verify end-to-end communication using Swagger UI and Kafka Console Consumer

This implementation showcases the use of **Apache Kafka as a distributed messaging platform** for building scalable and event-driven applications.
